Here's where I'm currently most productive.

## 1. Framework (Tanstack Start and React)

I've been working with React since 2020 so I'm most productive here. [Tanstack Start](https://tanstack.com/start) takes type-safety to another level - full end-to-end type inference for routes, params, and search queries. Less bloat than Next.js.

The latest AI models are _really_ good at React.

## 2. Styling (Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui)

Building flexible, accessible components is difficult. You either use (and extend) a component library, or build your own. This is why I use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

It provides well-designed and extensible components, built on top of accessible, unstyled primitives. This includes basics like buttons and inputs, but also icons, charts, and even custom themes.

Components are styled with Tailwind CSS, the most AI-friendly CSS library. Why? You can easily [colocate your styles ](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns) with your markup. This makes generating and editing code with AI tools much easier.

## 3. Database (Convex or Postgres and Drizzle)

For projects that require real-time features or have potential to make money, I reach for [Convex](https://convex.dev/). It streamlines backend development, is AI-friendly, and enables powerful features out of the box.

Otherwise, my go-to database is Postgres. [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) makes working with Postgres easy, type-safe, and fun. I can view and modify my data using Drizzle Studio and run migrations with Drizzle Kit.

Drizzle also works perfectly with TypeScript.

## 4. AI (opencode)

[opencode](https://opencode.ai/) - an open-source harness for agentic coding with access to all models and a wide plugin ecosystem. It had features like LSP tool calls before other harnesses.

I use [Oh My OpenCode (omo)](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode) for curated MCPs, subagents, and tools. On top of that: [supermemory](https://github.com/supermemoryai/opencode-supermemory) plugin for persistent memory, [playwriter](https://github.com/nichochar/playwriter) MCP for browser automation, and can chat remotely with sessions via [kimaki](https://github.com/remorses/kimaki).

## 5. Other Tools

### Editor (neovim)

Key plugins:
- **telescope** - fuzzy finding everything
- **harpoon** - quick file navigation
- **oil** - file explorer that feels like a buffer
- **conform** - formatting
- **blink** - completions

### Terminal (Ghostty)

Performant, great community, rasterizes fonts and renders nerd font icons correctly out of the box.

### Window Management (AeroSpace)

[AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) is a tiling window manager like i3 for macOS. I have main application layouts bound to spaces 1-5 with `cmd+<space-num>`.

### Tmux

Stock [oh-my-tmux](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux) config. The crucial addition is a tmux-sessionizer script (stolen from ThePrimeagen) for quickly switching between project sessions.

### VCS (jj)

[jj](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) is simpler, more powerful, and more flexible than git. Enables advanced workflows like simultaneously working on branches or stacked PRs.

### Hardware (Kinesis)

I use the [Kinesis Advantage 360 Pro](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/adv360pro/) split ergonomic keyboard with minor ZMK customizations on the extra keys.
