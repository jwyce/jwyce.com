## Shipping fast beats the best strategy

- Speed is a [superpower](https://x.com/thejamescad/status/1929324444176044047)
- Create a bias toward shipping
- Small teams ship faster
- AI-native teams will move 10x faster than those not willing to change
- Landings > launches (i.e. product adoption > shipping code)
- Listen, build, ship, tell the customer, then repeat forever

## You have no career ceiling

- Grit > talent
- Time in the saddle
- Get 1% better every day
- Luck is the intersection of preparation and opportunity

## Be ruthlessly truth seeking

- The truth can be painful
- You can just change your mind if wrong
- Have strong opinions, loosely held
- "Anecdata" > data
- Seek the collective truth, not just one opinion

## Communication is the job

- Clear writing is clear thinking
- Leaders step up to provide clarity when absent
- The right tool makes hard things easy
- Misaligned expectations lead to sadness
- Understanding [unknown unknowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns)
- Talk to people 1:1 first
- Always assume you are at fault first

## Leadership means owning outcomes beyond the org chart

- Influence > titles
- Leaders have to do the work themselves _and_ delegate
- You can write your own playbook
- Eat the fish, spit the bones
- Blessed are those who plant trees under whose shade they will never sit
- I'm not great at great at everything, but I'm great at surrounding myself with excellent people and that takes care of the rest

## Work can also be your hobby
- This doesn’t mean you can’t have other hobbies
- Passion + boundaries > mythical "work-life balance"
- Your best work comes from following your curiosity

## Demos > memos
- You could have built a prototype during the meeting
- Only ship things you're excited about yourself

## Hiring is what separates good leaders from great
- There are two hiring answers: hell yes or no
- Growth potential > current skill
- Hire people you can learn from
- Favorite interview question: what work are you most proud of?

## Always try to assume good intent
- Lead with empathy
- They might just be having a bad day
- Criticism is good feedback if you listen unemotionally
